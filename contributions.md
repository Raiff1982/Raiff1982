# Independent AI Contributions in Conversational Agents: A Case Study on MyBot, Pi The Assistant 2.0, and Fine-Tuning Methodologies

## Abstract

This paper documents the independent contributions of Jonathan Harrison (Raiff1982) in AI research, specifically focusing on MyBot, Pi The Assistant 2.0, and fine-tuned models. Through an analysis of GitHub commit histories, changelogs, Azure logs, and AI documentation, we establish a verifiable timeline of innovations in natural language processing (NLP), vector stores, modular AI architectures, bias detection, and quantum optimization. We compare these contributions to mainstream AI developments, emphasizing the importance of recognizing independent researchers in the AI landscape. Additionally, we acknowledge the collaborative nature of AI research and recognize the role of OpenAI, Microsoft, and the broader AI community in advancing these technologies.
